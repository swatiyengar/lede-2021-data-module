## Clone two repos
Use the first repo to keep up with changes I make and the second to do the exercises.

1. Directly clone this repo so you can pull in changes from `answers/` and `lessons/` and new `exercises/` templates. 
1. Then fork this repo to create your personal repo to make changes in the `exercises/` folder. This is the only folder you'll need to make edits to. Copy-and-paste exercise templates you have not completed from repo 1 here.
